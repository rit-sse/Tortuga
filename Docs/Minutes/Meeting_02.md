# Meeting Number 02 - 11/09/14

## Where we are

### We Got the Robot Moving!
* The images are posted here: http://imgur.com/a/PjwXU
* The Libraries were super easy to work with, and python (including forward, reverse, left, right)
* The board works really well for 2 motors
* The board has slots for other motors/servers, but those do not respond to the pre-defined commands
* The speed was really nice

## What we need to do next

### We need to figure out conversions
* The Motors use seconds, which need to be converted to work with the board
* Should only be a ratio

### We need to test out moving more than one second
* We're not sure at the moment if there's any acceleration issues

### Figure out what we're making our next case out of
* We may use legos for prototyping purposes, and then 3D print
* These legos will be available as soon as I can get them from the SE department.
* A design idea we had was using a dummy wheel on the north and south end, while having a real wheels on the east and west end.

### Figure out how to do curves
* If turtle's implementation of circles is crude (using a combination of turns and moving forward) then it might be easier

### Figure out if we want different motors or wheels
* The current configuration is really nice, and should work for the final model

### Figure out how to move the marker up and down
* One of the biggest issues is that a spring may push a motor or servo out of sync.
* If we don't have a spring, we won't know if we're actually pushing down on the board
* Many ideas were discussed, nothing has been decided yet
* We'll be discussing with ME students and professors for a professional design

### Need to buy magnets
* We might be able to get a "grab bag" of magnets
* We need to get a vendors list to find where the best places to buy is
