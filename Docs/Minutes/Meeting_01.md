# Meeting Number 01 - 10/26/2014

## Where we are
### We got the parts
We got the parts that were ordered by kurt, including
* Raspberry PI
* 4 Gearbox Motors
* 4 Wheels
* 2 Free-moving wheels
* RaspiRobot Board
### We're meeting now
We met in the SSE lab at 12pm
* The plan may be to continue having meetings at this time.

## Where we are going
### What we know it will do
We want the final version to draw on the whiteboard with existing python code (CS1).  
* This should be fundamentally easy, none of the CS1 code prohibits us by using complicated functions.
The library should work with most (not quite all) python-turtle functions.  
* These have been documented on the github repository.  
### We still need to do research
We need to look into how the RaspiRobot Board will let us talk to the motors.  
* These should be documented on sparkfun.
We need to decide / search for where we will be buying the magnets.
* We need to be able to buy different kinds of magnets from the same source.
We need to look into where we can do 3D printing on campus.
* There is such a place on campus, which may do it for free.
### We need to design
We need to design a case.  
* We can use a 3D modeling program (CAD, Blender, etc...) to do this.
We need to figure out how the marker is going to move inside the case.
