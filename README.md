Tortuga
=======

Tortuga is a most excellent endeavor to build an real-life interactive turtle interpreter that works on normal whiteboards. It is a SSE project that hopes to build both a useful learning tool for introductory students, as well as a framework for writing and drawing information that may be tedious or difficult to write down on a whiteboard.

The current vision is to build a small car that makes use of magnets, a Raspberry Pi, and several motors to move around a whiteboard with parallel functionallity to the python-turtle framework.
